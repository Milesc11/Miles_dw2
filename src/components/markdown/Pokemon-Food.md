# I Couldn't Decide What to Write About, So I'll Just Write My Ideas
## Pokemon That I Think Would Taste Good
- I feel like Whiscash would taste good
- Clodsire would be interesting to eat, only if you can remove the poison from it, like with a pufferfish for example
## Since I Was Talking About Eating, I Starting Thinking About Actual Food
- **I WANT RAMEN!**
- I'd also like to go to burger box at some point, the burgers there are so good.
## Drawing
- It's been a while since I've just been able to sit down and draw
- I'll make sure to get some drawing done over fall break (_Hopefully_).
